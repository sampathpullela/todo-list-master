# todo-list-master
This project is a simple To-Do List web app. It has an HTML structure with an input field and a button to add tasks. Tasks are displayed in a container. JavaScript handles adding tasks, clearing the input, changing task text color on focus, and removing tasks on double-click. CSS styles the layout and elements.
